CODE OF CONDUCT
===============

Shorter version

This code of conduct applies to all the OPEN Network spaces, including our mailing lists, Slack workspaces (including the OPEN wide, and OPEN tech&friends), GitHub discussions and code repositories, 
Facebook groups, any other online forums we may host or use, plus all OPEN online and in-person events. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these

Some OPEN Network spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants 
are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

Longer version
--------------
The OPEN Network is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of 
participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all The OPEN Network spaces, including our mailing lists, slack team, GitHub discussions, 
Facebook groups, and in-person events. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these 
spaces at the discretion of the [OPEN Tech Team](mailto:tech@the-open.net).

Some The OPEN Network spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. 
Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.

**Harassment includes:**

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, 
neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, 
drugs, and employment.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour  in spaces where they’re not appropriate.
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “*hug*” or “*backrub*”) without consent or 
after a request to stop.
* Threats of violence.
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
* Deliberate intimidation.
* Stalking or following.
* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
* Sustained disruption of discussion.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable 
people from intentional abuse.
* Publication of non-harassing private communication.

The OPEN Network prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The team reserves the right not 
to act on complaints regarding:

* ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
* Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
* Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

**Reporting**

If you are being harassed by a member of The OPEN Network, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other 
concerns, please contact Laura, Ben and Samson who are the OPEN tech team at [tech@the-open.net](mailto:tech@the-open.net). If the person who is harassing 
you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.

This code of conduct applies to OPEN Network spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of the OPEN Network outside 
our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by OPEN Network members 
seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse 
team reserves the right to exclude people from OPEN Network events and spaces based on their past behavior, including 
behavior outside OPEN Network spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the OPEN Network.

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been 
made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly 
name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that 
doing so will increase the safety of OPEN Network members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without 
their affirmative consent.

**Consequences**

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the OPEN tech team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and 
including expulsion from all OPEN Network spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other OPEN Network 
members or the general public.
