open-and-friends Github directory
=================================

Add yourself and your repositories to this list! All members of the open-and-friends
team should have read/write access to this readme file.

If you'd like to keep a fork of your work on OPEN's GitHub, any member of the
open-and-friends team can create forks, even private ones. Get in touch with me
(michaelsnook) if you'd like me to grant read and/or write access for one of
these repos to the rest of the team.
